A few simple VMware PowerCLI scripts that I wrote & tinkered around with to automate several aspects of my home lab.

Credit to the following books that taught me the basics of PowerCLI:

- [*Philip Sellers - PowerCLI Cookbook - Over 75 step-by-step recipes to put PowerCLI into action for efficient administration of your virtual environment*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/PowerCLI_Cookbook/aOXuBwAAQBAJ)
