# homelab
This document describes my home lab environment utilizing VMware vSphere 7 for virtualization.
# Goals
I built this homelab for a few reasons. First off, it's like a giant playground for tech geeks! I can spin up virtual machines and try out all sorts of new products and technologies, which is great for learning.  Second, it helps me out at work.  By mimicking my customers' VMware setups, I can test things out and make sure everything works smoothly before they even see it.  Finally, this homelab is my training ground for certification exams like CNCF CKA/CKS, VMware VCP/VCAP, and Terraform. Basically, it's all about getting hands-on and leveling up my IT skills!
